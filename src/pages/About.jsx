            As a full-stack developer, I have a deep understanding of React and JavaScript, which I use to build highly interactive and user-centric web applications. By leveraging React's powerful component-based architecture, I craft dynamic UIs that respond to user input with seamless state management, utilizing both Redux and React Context for global state handling. My proficiency in TypeScript allows me to build type-safe applications, ensuring that the code is robust and less prone to errors, ultimately improving both the development and debugging process. I am adept at implementing complex routing solutions with React Router and ensuring the performance of applications by optimizing re-renders and efficiently handling asynchronous data with React Query.

            On the back-end, I leverage JavaScript to build scalable and secure server-side applications. I am well-versed in SQL, particularly with databases like PostgreSQL and MySQL, and I design optimized database schemas and write efficient, complex queries to ensure high performance in data operations. Whether it's building CRUD operations for an API or designing complex relationships between tables, I ensure smooth data flow between the front-end and back-end. My experience in combining TypeScript with SQL allows me to craft applications that are not only fast and scalable but also maintainable and secure. My skills in both front-end and back-end technologies ensure that I can deliver end-to-end solutions with a focus on performance and reliability.
